      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Without our muscles, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t move. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t eat, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t talk, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t even breathe. Our heart would not work because the heart is a muscle, too.
All of these things require a movement. We control some of the muscles but some just keep going, like the heart, or the breathing process. Our stomach would not be able to digest the food we eat.
Did you know there are three types of muscles?</description>

      <description>There could be a lot of weird things just lying around your house. Take a closer look at all of them. You can add some weird things to this article when you finish reading it.
Weird Thing #1 These are two carrots that grew together. They twisted around each other and grew together at the top. You can take the two twisted parts apart but you can never take it apart into two twisty carrots because, as I already said, they grew together at the top.</description>

      <description>Fastfins are not afraid of eels. Normally, all dragons are afraid of eels but not fastfins. However, Summer is a fastfin and she is afraid of eels. Why? When she was little, she was playing with her friends in an ocean. Her friends swam away and when she turned to follow, there was an eel and it bit her. And that is why Summer is afraid of eels.
(When my dad was little, a rooster attacked him and then for a long time, he was afraid of any birds that came near him.</description>

      <description>Here are two fossils from my collection.
Fossil 1 This fossil is about 145 million years old. It is from the early Cretaceous Period. It is older than a Tyranosaurus Rex who lived in the Late Cretaceous Time Period. The Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous Periods are all parts of the Mezozoic Era, also called the age of dinosaurs.
This fossil is a pelecypod and it is sometimes called Devil&amp;rsquo;s Toenail. It is a kind of oyster.</description>

      <description>When two or more Fire Furies shoot the biggest fireball they can at the same time into the air and the fireballs crash together, it makes a big explosion that looks like fireworks.
For example, in Furious Fun (Season 1, Episode 12), Aggro, Laburn, and Cinda make a huge firework.

      <description>Golden Dragons are legendary. They lay an egg only once every 100 years. Golden Dragons can shoot streams of golden glitter. The glitter is hard to get off once it sticks and you definitely don&amp;rsquo;t want to get it in your eyes.
Gemma appears in the special Hunt for the Golden Dragon.

      <description>Relentless Razorwings are known for having awesome eye sight. They can find basically anything, even a needle in a haystack.
(For example, in Secrets of the Songwing, Cutter finds Aggro on an island far away.)

      <description>Swiftwings are the fastest dragons on the planet. They are so fast that if they came to Earth, they would fly faster than a peregrine falcon. They would be faster than a mole on a motorbike. They are great at flying tricks. They have three powerblasts and when they are old enough, they can have one megablast.
For example, in Grumblegard Part 2 (Season 1, Episode 14), Winger defeats the Slinkwings with a megablast.</description>
