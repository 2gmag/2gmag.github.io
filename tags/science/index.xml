      <description>Without our muscles, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t move. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t eat, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t talk, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t even breathe. Our heart would not work because the heart is a muscle, too.
All of these things require a movement. We control some of the muscles but some just keep going, like the heart, or the breathing process. Our stomach would not be able to digest the food we eat.
Did you know there are three types of muscles?</description>

      <description>Here are two fossils from my collection.
Fossil 1 This fossil is about 145 million years old. It is from the early Cretaceous Period. It is older than a Tyranosaurus Rex who lived in the Late Cretaceous Time Period. The Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous Periods are all parts of the Mezozoic Era, also called the age of dinosaurs.
This fossil is a pelecypod and it is sometimes called Devil&amp;rsquo;s Toenail. It is a kind of oyster.</description>
