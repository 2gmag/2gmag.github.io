      <description>Without our muscles, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t move. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t eat, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t talk, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t even breathe. Our heart would not work because the heart is a muscle, too.
All of these things require a movement. We control some of the muscles but some just keep going, like the heart, or the breathing process. Our stomach would not be able to digest the food we eat.
Did you know there are three types of muscles?</description>

      <description>There could be a lot of weird things just lying around your house. Take a closer look at all of them. You can add some weird things to this article when you finish reading it.
Weird Thing #1 These are two carrots that grew together. They twisted around each other and grew together at the top. You can take the two twisted parts apart but you can never take it apart into two twisty carrots because, as I already said, they grew together at the top.</description>

      <description>Here are two fossils from my collection.
Fossil 1 This fossil is about 145 million years old. It is from the early Cretaceous Period. It is older than a Tyranosaurus Rex who lived in the Late Cretaceous Time Period. The Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous Periods are all parts of the Mezozoic Era, also called the age of dinosaurs.
This fossil is a pelecypod and it is sometimes called Devil&amp;rsquo;s Toenail. It is a kind of oyster.</description>
